    * they look for communication, problem solving, coding, and verification
    * practice coding the way you'll code during your tech screen (2 questions in 35 mins while thinking aloud)
    * know time and space complexity well 
    * focus on edge cases
    * know how things work under the hood (well known library functions)
    * ask clarifying questions
    * generally avoid solutions with a lot of edge cases
    * they have an amazing list of topics and questions on here
        *Array, String, Linked List, Stacks, Queues, Hash, Heaps, Maps, Sorting, Trees, Graphs,Recursion

    * explain what the data structure you'e using is like its not obvious 
    * ask clarifying questions about the input
    * talk about the algorithms you can use 
    * sonja was always talking, like almost no silence
    * think outloud
    * before you start coding explain the approach you want to take to your interviewer and get approval
    * define your classes (ex: a node)
    * check your edge cases 
    * check if things are okay with your interviewer before you do them 
    * keep talking to show ur interviewer your problem solving skill and to have a chance for redirection
    * you probably wont run code in the oline coding environment cuz u cant ona whiteboard. Syntax isnt impoertant, knowing the feature is.
    * work through a test case or a few to show the interviewer, and with edge cases
    * be prepared to discuss time and space complexity
    * theyre gonna ask you if you can make it more efficient
    * after coming up with a logical solution ask your interviewer to confirm you're on the right track and if they'd want you to 
    take a different approach
    * ask meaningful qs at the end
    * explain how u want to solve problem to interviewer before

    * technical screen -> 2 coding interviews & 1 design & 1 algo -> 
    * college students dont get much design questions
    * you can get asked either 1 or 2 questions
    * behavioral qs:
        * prepare a quick walkthru of ur resume (show ur success, prompt them to ask qs, hobbies)
        * make sure to talk about teamwork
        * don't get defensive about criticisms
    * Design Questions
        * You should approach desing questions with WWYDAW (wouldja): what would you do at work
        * Scope the problem, define key componenets, identify issues, repair and redesign
        * ex if u go asked to build the system that shows u amazon's best selling, you need to define best selling means
    *
