/*
Uses:
    * this is a strategy to solve a problem by combining solutions of subproblems to get the solution of a main problem
    * every subproblem has to be the same
    * you need to have some way to combine the solutions to the subproblems
    * it is recursive in nature
    * you use reccurance relations to find the big O
    * Examples: Merge Sort, Binary search

General method:
    * breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly
    * The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem
